# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev      # Start development server (http://localhost:3000)
npm run build    # Build for production
npm run start    # Start production server
npm run lint     # Run ESLint (eslint-config-next with core-web-vitals and typescript)
```

## Architecture

This is a Next.js 16 project using the App Router with React 19 and TypeScript.

- **app/**: App Router pages and layouts
  - `layout.tsx`: Root layout with Geist font configuration
  - `page.tsx`: Home page
  - `components/`: React components
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 with PostCSS

### Path Aliases

Use `@/*` to import from the project root (configured in tsconfig.json).


# MCP Servers

## General purpose rules
- IMPORTANT: Always use components from `/components/**/*` when possible
- Prioritize Figma fidelity to match designs exactly
- Avoid hardcoded values, use design tokens from Figma where available
- Follow WCAG requirements for accessibility
- Add component documentation
- Place UI components in `/components/atoms`; avoid inline styles unless truly necessary

## Figma MCP Integration Rules
These rules define how to translate Figma inputs into code for this project and must be followed for every Figma-driven change.

### Required flow (do not skip)
1. Run get_design_context first to fetch the structured representation for the exact node(s).
2. If the response is too large or truncated, run get_metadata to get the high‑level node map and then re‑fetch only the required node(s) with get_design_context.
3. Run get_screenshot for a visual reference of the node variant being implemented.
4. Only after you have both get_design_context and get_screenshot, download any assets needed and start implementation.
5. Translate the output (usually React + Tailwind) into this project's conventions, styles and framework.  Reuse the project's color tokens, components, and typography wherever possible.
6. Validate against Figma for 1:1 look and behavior before marking complete.

### Implementation rules
- Treat the Figma MCP output (React + Tailwind) as a representation of design and behavior, not as final code style.
- Replace Tailwind utility classes with the project's preferred utilities/design‑system tokens when applicable.
- Reuse existing components (e.g., buttons, inputs, typography, icon wrappers) instead of duplicating functionality.
- Use the project's color system, typography scale, and spacing tokens consistently.
- Respect existing routing, state management, and data‑fetch patterns already adopted in the repo.
- Strive for 1:1 visual parity with the Figma design. When conflicts arise, prefer design‑system tokens and adjust spacing or sizes minimally to match visuals.
- Validate the final UI against the Figma screenshot for both look and behavior.

## Figma MCP server rules
  - The Figma MCP server provides an assets endpoint which can serve image and SVG assets
  - IMPORTANT: If the Figma MCP server returns a localhost source for an image or an SVG, use that image or SVG source directly
  - IMPORTANT: DO NOT import/add new icon packages, all the assets should be in the Figma payload
  - IMPORTANT: do NOT use or create placeholders if a localhost source is provided
